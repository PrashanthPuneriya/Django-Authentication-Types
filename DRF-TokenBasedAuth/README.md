# DRF-Default-Token-Based-Authentication

## Extension of auth2-AbstractUser

- Uses `rest_framework.authtoken` i.e. Token Authentication
- Demostrates custom implementation of
  - Registration
  - Token generation for the new user
  - Login
  - ChangePassword
 
 The custom implementation of Registration and Login has been implemented vaguely. It needs further improvements.
